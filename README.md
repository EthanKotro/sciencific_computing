# Scientific Computing
Assignments and projects from Scientific Computing class

## Objectives

1. **datatypes.py** - Shows the variety of Python data types how they are converted and checking their class types.
2. **control_structures.py** - Demonstrates conditional statements, loops, and function usage.
3. **modular_functions.py** - Implements modular functions for calculating areas of different shapes.

## How to Run the Scripts

### Running `datatypes.py`

```bash
python datatypes.py
```

### Running `control_structures.py`

```bash
python control_structures.py
```

### Running `modular_functions.py`

```bash
python modular_functions.py
```


## What I Learned

- The different data types in Python and how they are converted to other types, and telling the class it belongs to.

- Using control structures like for loops, while loops and conditions like if and dealing with decrement.
- Defining and using functions and using modularity to ensure reusability of code.
- Using Pythonâ€™s built-in functions like `type()`, `math.pi`, and handling user input.
- Documenting and formating in Github `README.md` .
- Initializing and commiting a git repository from local device through the terminal.
