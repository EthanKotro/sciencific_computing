# Python Scripts for Learning Data Types, Control Structures, and Modularity

## Objective

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts:

1. **datatypes.py** - Explores Python data types, their conversions, and type checking.
2. **control_structures.py** - Demonstrates conditional statements, loops, and function usage.
3. **modular_functions.py** - Implements modular functions for calculating areas of different shapes.

## How to Run the Scripts

### Running `datatypes.py`

```bash
python datatypes.py
```

- This script prints variable types, converts integer to float and vice versa.

### Running `control_structures.py`

```bash
python control_structures.py
```

- Asks for an integer input and determines if it is even or odd.
- Generates and prints even numbers from 1 to 50.
- Prints numbers from 10 down to 1 using a while loop.

### Running `modular_functions.py`

```bash
python modular_functions.py
```

- Calls a function to compute the area of a circle, rectangle, and triangle.

## What I Learned

- Understanding and using different Python data types effectively.
- Implementing control structures such as loops and conditional statements.
- Writing modular and reusable functions for better code structure.
- Using Pythonâ€™s built-in functions like `type()`, `math.pi`, and user input handling.
- Structuring a GitHub repository with clear documentation in `README.md`.
